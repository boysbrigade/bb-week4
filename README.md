## Tasks
This week you need to add some more CSS to your website.

### Task 1
Add a class to at least 2 elements in your page to give them a specific style.  
**Use the 1 class for both elements.**

### Task 2
Add a new class to one of the elements you added a class to in Task 1.  
This element should now have 2 classes.

### Task 3
Add a ID to your Unordered List element.  
This will become your navigation bar.  
Add the class `navitem` to each of the list items in your navigation bar.  
Add the class `navlink` to each of the links in your navigation bar.  
Create a div element after the navigation bar. with the id `navbreak`.  

Your code should look something like this:

```html
<ul id="navbar">
    <li class="navitem"><a href="#" class="navlink">Home</a></li>
    <li class="navitem"><a href="#" class="navlink">About</a></li>
</ul>
<div id="navbreak"></div>
```

Copy the CSS from [nav.css](nav.css) to your CSS file.  
You can edit this to change the style of your navigation bar.
